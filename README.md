### ♿ Accessibility Commitment
The architecture of E-Sarkari Rehnuma prioritizes inclusivity. By implementing **Urdu Nastaliq typography**, high-contrast visual elements, and universal voice support, the platform ensures that essential information is accessible to all demographics, regardless of technological proficiency.

### 📂 How it Works
1. **The Core:** The system scans keywords from user voice/text input to provide relevant guidance.
2. **The Seeder:** Data is managed via `services.csv` and `steps.csv`, ensuring the platform can scale to hundreds of services easily.
3. **The UX:** Large buttons and audio-first feedback loops minimize "procedural anxiety" for first-time users.
